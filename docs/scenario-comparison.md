# OpenTelemetry + Datadog Deployment Scenarios Comparison

This document provides a detailed comparison of the three deployment scenarios in this lab.

## Overview

| Scenario | Description | Architecture | Use Case |
|----------|-------------|--------------|----------|
| **Scenario 1** | Direct to Datadog Agent | Apps → OTLP → Datadog Agent → Datadog | Simple setup, Datadog-native |
| **Scenario 2** | Via OpenTelemetry Collector | Apps → OTLP → OTel Collector → Datadog | Vendor-neutral, flexible |
| **Scenario 3** | DDOT Collector | Apps → OTLP → Datadog Agent (DDOT) → Datadog | Best of both worlds |

## Detailed Comparison

### Scenario 1: Direct to Datadog Agent

**Architecture Flow:**
```
Microservices → OTLP → Datadog Agent → Datadog Platform
```

**Key Features:**
- Direct OTLP ingestion by Datadog Agent

- Simplified telemetry pipeline
- Full Datadog feature integration
- Automatic service discovery
- Built-in sampling and filtering

**Pros:**
✅ Simple configuration and deployment
✅ Optimal performance (fewer hops)
✅ Native Datadog features (profiling, security)
✅ Lower resource usage
✅ Automatic correlation with infrastructure metrics

**Cons:**
❌ Vendor lock-in to Datadog
❌ Limited telemetry processing flexibility
❌ Less portable across observability platforms

**Best For:**
- Organizations fully committed to Datadog
- Simple monitoring requirements
- Resource-constrained environments
- Quick proof-of-concepts

### Scenario 2: Via OpenTelemetry Collector

**Architecture Flow:**
```
Microservices → OTLP → OpenTelemetry Collector → Datadog Exporter → Datadog Platform
```

**Key Features:**
- Vendor-neutral OpenTelemetry Collector
- Flexible telemetry processing pipeline
- Standard OTel ecosystem compatibility
- Custom processors and exporters
- Multi-vendor export capability

**Pros:**
✅ Vendor-neutral and portable
✅ Flexible data processing and routing
✅ Extensible with custom components
✅ Multi-destination export
✅ Community-driven development

**Cons:**
❌ More complex configuration
❌ Additional resource overhead
❌ Potential compatibility issues
❌ More moving parts to manage

**Best For:**
- Multi-vendor observability strategies
- Complex telemetry processing requirements
- Organizations avoiding vendor lock-in
- Advanced filtering and sampling needs

### Scenario 3: DDOT Collector (Datadog Distribution of OpenTelemetry)

**Architecture Flow:**
```
Microservices → OTLP → Datadog Agent (DDOT Collector) → Datadog Platform
```

**Key Features:**
- Datadog's curated OpenTelemetry distribution
- Combines OTel flexibility with Datadog enterprise features
- Enhanced Kubernetes attribute processing
- Unified service tagging out-of-the-box
- Fleet automation support

**Pros:**
✅ Best of both worlds approach
✅ Datadog-optimized OTel components
✅ Enterprise support and reliability
✅ Advanced Kubernetes integration
✅ Seamless Datadog feature access

**Cons:**
❌ Still tied to Datadog ecosystem
❌ Limited to Datadog-curated components
❌ Newer offering with evolving features

**Best For:**
- Organizations wanting OTel flexibility with Datadog benefits
- Kubernetes-heavy environments
- Teams needing enterprise support
- Gradual migration from proprietary to open standards

### Operational Considerations

| Aspect | Scenario 1 | Scenario 2 | Scenario 3 |
|--------|------------|------------|------------|
| Setup Complexity | Simple | Complex | Medium |
| Maintenance | Low | High | Medium |
| Troubleshooting | Easy | Complex | Medium |
| Scaling | Automatic | Manual | Enhanced |
| Monitoring | Built-in | Custom | Enhanced |

## Migration Paths

### From Scenario 1 to Scenario 2
1. Deploy OpenTelemetry Collector
2. Update application OTLP endpoints
3. Configure Datadog exporter
4. Disable Datadog Agent OTLP receiver

### From Scenario 1 to Scenario 3
1. Update Datadog Agent to enable DDOT Collector
2. Apply new configuration
3. No application changes needed

### From Scenario 2 to Scenario 3
1. Deploy Datadog Agent with DDOT Collector
2. Update application OTLP endpoints
3. Migrate configurations
4. Remove standalone OTel Collector

## Recommendations

### Choose Scenario 1 if:
- You're fully committed to Datadog
- Simplicity is priority
- Resource efficiency matters
- You need quick deployment

### Choose Scenario 2 if:
- Vendor neutrality is important
- You need complex telemetry processing
- Multi-vendor export is required
- You have OTel expertise

### Choose Scenario 3 if:
- You want OTel flexibility with Datadog benefits
- You're running on Kubernetes
- You need enterprise support
- You're planning gradual OTel adoption

## Getting Started

1. **Install Operators**: `./scripts/operators/install-operators.sh`
2. **Choose Your Scenario**:
   - Scenario 1: `./scripts/operators/deploy-scenario1.sh`
   - Scenario 2: `./scripts/operators/deploy-scenario2.sh`
   - Scenario 3: `./scripts/operators/deploy-scenario3.sh`
3. **Access Applications**: Follow the output instructions for port-forwarding
4. **Monitor in Datadog**: Check your Datadog dashboard for telemetry data

Each scenario includes comprehensive monitoring, Git version tagging for source code integration, and production-ready configurations.
